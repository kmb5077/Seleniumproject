54 Thompson Street,Soho/Nolita,"$19,750,000",Condo,4,6.5,16,"7,500","54 Thompson, Penthouse: “Hope Diamond” in the Rough
Rarely does a penthouse loft of this scale hit the market, even in Soho, the birthplace of oversized loft-living. At roughly 10,000 square feet of combined indoor and outdoor terrace space, the palatial Soho penthouse for sale at 54 Thompson is a unique find.
The average loft in Soho is 1,924 square feet, and there are only 52 known lofts that surpass 5,000 square feet. To further emphasize the rarity of this giant home, only 10 lofts over 7,500 square feet have ever been on the market in Soho, and of those, only 2 had private terraces. Neither of those 2 has 54 Thompson's four exposures and views of both the Empire State Building and World Trade Center.
In addition to its enormous scale, 54 Thompson offers a unique level of privacy appreciated by those discerning clients looking for maximum discretion in the heart of Soho. Although this address is right in the middle of Soho—the front door is only 100 yards from West Broadway—this block has far less pedestrian traffic than neighboring areas, primarily because there are far fewer retail shops and restaurants than on any of the surrounding blocks. As a direct result of this, the quiet, secluded block has a “throwback” appeal more akin to the Soho of yesteryear.
The building itself also contributes greatly to the home’s highly-sought-after privacy in that it is almost entirely commercial, with only one other residential loft. This means that during evenings and weekends—the times you are most likely to be home or have guests—the building is almost entirely yours. This makes the penthouse ideal for entertaining.
You know you are going to experience something epic from the moment you enter the large keyed elevator; at 9x15, the lift is larger than some studio apartments I have sold. This keyed elevator services both floors of this home as well as the roof.
However, not even the elevator can prepare you for the enormity of this home. At nearly 3,000 square feet, with windows on all sides, the living/dining space alone is larger than the entirety of all but a handful of most generous lofts in the area.
Combined with 14-foot ceiling heights throughout, it takes “open concept living” to dizzying new heights. At 36’ x 57’, the main ballroom is so cavernous, it makes the 17’ x 20’ TV nook appear positively cozy by comparison. There’s ample space here to host everything from intimate get-togethers to hundred-guest rave parties. Sunlight from multiple skylights and giant windows keeps the main space bright and airy.
The huge restaurant-level kitchen is outfitted for the convenience of both home cooks and professional chefs, and features granite countertops, a Miele Turbothermic Plus dishwasher, GE trash compactor, 20+ drawers, 16+ cabinets and two separate double-chambered farm sinks. The extra-large stainless steel gas range setup features 2 ovens, a warming drawer, 6+ stovetop burners, a grill, and a griddle, as well as an oversized hood. Lit by both sunny windows and overhead track spotlights, this is a bright and pleasant place to make your next culinary masterpiece.
If the weather is good, why not bring all those guests up to your private rooftop terrace? With 2,500 square feet, direct access from the living room, and wide-open views in all directions, this landscaped outdoor space is an impressive place for open-air entertainment. The terrace has plenty of privacy provided by a plethora of vine-covered pergolas, established flowering trees and shrubbery, and since very few neighboring buildings have direct views of the roof, even A-listers can feel comfortable dropping their guard.
If you feel particularly magnanimous, why not prepare an al fresco feast for your guests on the professional-grade outdoor kitchen featuring a stainless steel Subzero Wolf grill? If you prefer to let staff to do the heavy lifting, cooking and serving is made easier with the dumbwaiter connecting the indoor and outdoor kitchens, as well as by the stainless steel prep space and farm sink attached to the terrace cooking area.
If, after all that entertaining, you need a break, there is plenty of room for a luxurious respite for both owners and guests. The current layout has 3 master suites, each of them an oasis complete with its own walk-in closet and spa-like full bathroom. However, with some minor adjustments, this home can have 5 bedrooms with ease. As all but one of the suites are on a different level from the common living area, and the 6th floor also has direct access to the elevator, these quarters are truly private and easily accessible.
54 Thompson Street PH is the crown jewel of Soho lofts—a rare and precious penthouse find for a sophisticated buyer. Like a diamond that sparkles in a variety of settings, this beautiful property will adapt to a range of needs and will shine brightly enough to impress even the most selective buyer.

Additional features of this property include: Kitchen: Gourmet, Kitchen: Open Kitchen, Kitchen: Stainless Steel Appliances, Layout: Full Floor, Layout: Mezzanine, Rooms: Dressing Area, Rooms: Formal Dining Room, Rooms: Gallery, and Rooms: Home Office."

The limestone, cast stone and beige-brick tower, designed Frank Williams & Associates, is a Post-Modern CONDO building that seeks to carry on the Avenue's predominantly Italian Renaissance-palazzo (co-op) tradition. No developer has been more successful at marrying prewar-inspired design with thoroughly contemporary layouts and amenities than the Zeckendorf's, and 515 Park is clear proof of that success.

In addition, there are private, climate-controlled wine cellars and individual storage rooms.
The prewar-inspired design extends into the home where, from the moment you open the door, the herringbone floors harken back to the craftsmanship of a bygone era, while the light stain immediately tells you this is a contemporary apartment. The generously proportioned rooms and high ceilings enhance the airy feel of the home, and expansive windows invite light and great views of Park Avenue.
This original three-bedroom three and a half bath residence is currently configured as a two bedroom, (both with en-suite baths), separated by an oversized entry gallery offering maximum privacy. The home also has the large eat-in kitchen with, premium-grade appliances, formal dining and living rooms, and a generous library, making it an ideal place to entertain, or just to relax.

Current upgrades to the apartment include fine wood working throughout, custom kitchen cabinetry, marble countertops, individual climate control and wiring for surround-sound stereo systems.
Despite its closeness to the Midtown Business District, the location of 515 Park Avenue is relatively quiet, but close to many famous stores, boutiques, restaurants and cultural institutions. There is excellent public transportation within a few blocks, and how can one overlook that Central Park is near enough to be seen from the living room.

880 Fifth Avenue,Upper East Side,"$1,225,000",Co-op,na,1.5,4,"1,130","In 1948 Richard Roth Jr., son of vaunted architect Emery Roth, came home from the war. One of the first things he did was to ‘modernize’ his father’s completed plans for 880 Fifth Avenue, the final building the elder Roth designed and one of the most dignified, well-serviced co-ops on Fifth Avenue. When Emery questioned his son’s alterations, Richard was said to have asked his father if that is how the elder Roth became famous, a reply the father always cherished. Apartment 11A exemplifies the transition in interior design from early 20th C to modern era apartment planning. This is seen in an openness of space and wealth of sunlight enlivening the apartment, conveyed through a wall of bow-front windows. The entrance gallery connects to an opulent living room and dining area providing over 45 feet of brilliant entertainment space including a powder room. An ample east-facing master bedroom suite is adjacent to a 12 x 8 dressing room, home office or 2nd bedroom. The well-placed kitchen flanks the dining area. The floorplan is a paragon of design for a Manhattan one-bedroom apartment. Equally impressive is the impeccable 24h white glove service afforded by attentive doormen, a concierge and elevator operators which evoke an earlier era of luxury living. An ever-ready building staff is headed by a consummate live-in super. The airy lobby and its lovely interior garden are a marvel of mid-century ambiance and décor. Amenities include a garage with reduced rates for residents, a cutting-edge gym with Pilates/yoga facilities and an individual storage bin. Cats are welcome, but, sorry, no dogs. Pieds a terre permitted. A 3% flip tax is paid by the buyer. An entrance to Central Park is directly across the street. The Frick Museum, superb restaurants and the delights of Madison Avenue are close by. On this spot once stood the mansion of Edward H. Harriman, president of the Union Pacific Railroad and father of Averell Harriman, 48th Governor of New York. There is no better place to live in Manhattan.
