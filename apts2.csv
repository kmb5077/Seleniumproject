54 Thompson Street,Soho/Nolita,"$19,750,000 ",Condo,4,6.5,16,"7,500","54 Thompson, Penthouse: “Hope Diamond” in the Rough
Rarely does a penthouse loft of this scale hit the market, even in Soho, the birthplace of oversized loft-living. At roughly 10,000 square feet of combined indoor and outdoor terrace space, the palatial Soho penthouse for sale at 54 Thompson is a unique find.
The average loft in Soho is 1,924 square feet, and there are only 52 known lofts that surpass 5,000 square feet. To further emphasize the rarity of this giant home, only 10 lofts over 7,500 square feet have ever been on the market in Soho, and of those, only 2 had private terraces. Neither of those 2 has 54 Thompson's four exposures and views of both the Empire State Building and World Trade Center.
In addition to its enormous scale, 54 Thompson offers a unique level of privacy appreciated by those discerning clients looking for maximum discretion in the heart of Soho. Although this address is right in the middle of Soho—the front door is only 100 yards from West Broadway—this block has far less pedestrian traffic than neighboring areas, primarily because there are far fewer retail shops and restaurants than on any of the surrounding blocks. As a direct result of this, the quiet, secluded block has a “throwback” appeal more akin to the Soho of yesteryear.
The building itself also contributes greatly to the home’s highly-sought-after privacy in that it is almost entirely commercial, with only one other residential loft. This means that during evenings and weekends—the times you are most likely to be home or have guests—the building is almost entirely yours. This makes the penthouse ideal for entertaining.
You know you are going to experience something epic from the moment you enter the large keyed elevator; at 9x15, the lift is larger than some studio apartments I have sold. This keyed elevator services both floors of this home as well as the roof.
However, not even the elevator can prepare you for the enormity of this home. At nearly 3,000 square feet, with windows on all sides, the living/dining space alone is larger than the entirety of all but a handful of most generous lofts in the area.
Combined with 14-foot ceiling heights throughout, it takes “open concept living” to dizzying new heights. At 36’ x 57’, the main ballroom is so cavernous, it makes the 17’ x 20’ TV nook appear positively cozy by comparison. There’s ample space here to host everything from intimate get-togethers to hundred-guest rave parties. Sunlight from multiple skylights and giant windows keeps the main space bright and airy.
The huge restaurant-level kitchen is outfitted for the convenience of both home cooks and professional chefs, and features granite countertops, a Miele Turbothermic Plus dishwasher, GE trash compactor, 20+ drawers, 16+ cabinets and two separate double-chambered farm sinks. The extra-large stainless steel gas range setup features 2 ovens, a warming drawer, 6+ stovetop burners, a grill, and a griddle, as well as an oversized hood. Lit by both sunny windows and overhead track spotlights, this is a bright and pleasant place to make your next culinary masterpiece.
If the weather is good, why not bring all those guests up to your private rooftop terrace? With 2,500 square feet, direct access from the living room, and wide-open views in all directions, this landscaped outdoor space is an impressive place for open-air entertainment. The terrace has plenty of privacy provided by a plethora of vine-covered pergolas, established flowering trees and shrubbery, and since very few neighboring buildings have direct views of the roof, even A-listers can feel comfortable dropping their guard.
If you feel particularly magnanimous, why not prepare an al fresco feast for your guests on the professional-grade outdoor kitchen featuring a stainless steel Subzero Wolf grill? If you prefer to let staff to do the heavy lifting, cooking and serving is made easier with the dumbwaiter connecting the indoor and outdoor kitchens, as well as by the stainless steel prep space and farm sink attached to the terrace cooking area.
If, after all that entertaining, you need a break, there is plenty of room for a luxurious respite for both owners and guests. The current layout has 3 master suites, each of them an oasis complete with its own walk-in closet and spa-like full bathroom. However, with some minor adjustments, this home can have 5 bedrooms with ease. As all but one of the suites are on a different level from the common living area, and the 6th floor also has direct access to the elevator, these quarters are truly private and easily accessible.
54 Thompson Street PH is the crown jewel of Soho lofts—a rare and precious penthouse find for a sophisticated buyer. Like a diamond that sparkles in a variety of settings, this beautiful property will adapt to a range of needs and will shine brightly enough to impress even the most selective buyer.

Additional features of this property include: Kitchen: Gourmet, Kitchen: Open Kitchen, Kitchen: Stainless Steel Appliances, Layout: Full Floor, Layout: Mezzanine, Rooms: Dressing Area, Rooms: Formal Dining Room, Rooms: Gallery, and Rooms: Home Office."

Designed by Henry J. Hadenbergh, The Dakota offers legendary NYC living thanks to its incredible architecture and illustrious list of current and past residents. Long considered the iconic residential building of the Upper West Side, The Dakota architecture includes opulent finials, oil-burning lamps, and a manned sentry greets residents and their guests. From the elegant porte cochere entrance you can see glimpses of a fountain, located at the center of The Dakota's beautiful interior courtyard. Once serving as a carriage turnaround, the courtyard now functions as a meeting point for the building's four separate lobbies. Inside the building itself, the apartments feature uniquely carved fireplace mantels, and towering mahogany doors. French architectural details, popular at the turn of the century, are visible everywhere. Each apartment enjoys an enfilade layout, which allows rooms to be connected to each other through a traditional hall or corridor, offering an increased sense of privacy throughout. The Dakota is a full service white glove building which has recently added a brand new fitness center to complement the amenities."

Own a piece of history at the Ansonia Condominium at 2109 Broadway, between West 73rd and West 74th Streets. Originally constructed as a the grandest hotel in Manhattan in 1899 (commissioned to architect Paul E. Duboy), ""the farm on the roof,"" Weddie Stokes wrote, ""included about 500 chickens, many ducks, about six goats and a small bear."" According to history, every day a bellhop delivered free fresh eggs to all the tenants, and any surplus was sold cheaply to the public in the basement arcade. The farm in the sky was shuttered in 1907, but no fear...you are no more than 2 blocks away from Fairway, Citarella and Trader Joes.
