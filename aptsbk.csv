194 MacDonough Street,Bedford-Stuyvesant,"$3,495,000 ",Townhouse,6,4.5,10,"3,650","""Wow"" is by far the most common reaction upon entering 194 MacDonough Street. It's not just the meticulous, top to bottom renovation. It's not just the grand proportions including high ceilings, wide rooms and over-sized windows. It's the seamless weaving together of a little old and a lot of new, with a Zen-like, Scandinavian simplicity. It's the transformation of dark, 19th century details into a bright, airy and breathtaking space. It is, in fact, nothing quite like you've seen before in the neighborhood.
The house is both unique and turnkey. Built in 1887 in what is now Stuyvesant Heights, 194 MacDonough Street is a four story, two-unit landmarked brownstone built 20' x 45' with an extension on a 100' lot.
The parlor floor features most of the restored 19th century details: the original, carved fireplace mantle and pier mirror, fretwork window casings with plantation shutters, and lovely sliding pocket doors with their original hardware (and the key!). Then the 21st century takes over with a sleek, minimalist aesthetic. The contemporary kitchen, with dining that easily seats ten, is outfitted in Subzero, Miele, Bosch and Thermador, with an oversized Kohler farm sink and a massive pantry. A lovely slate terrace off the dining area leads down to the garden.
No two baths in this house are alike, each designed with its own, unique yet neutral patterns and materials. The second floor can be used as either a floor-through master suite with vast sitting room or two separate bedrooms. All bedrooms are spacious and bright with plenty of closet space and lovely new trim. Four working fireplaces have been completely renovated and grace nearly every room in the house. Laundry is on the third floor, and all floors, including the immaculate white oak floors throughout the living areas as well as every full bath, are radiantly heated and individually zoned. Likewise, concealed, ducted central air conditioning is separately zoned for each room.
Also atypical is the spacious garden apartment, designed not as an afterthought, but with attention to detail. The massive open kitchen has a checkerboard feel to the cabinetry and a complete stainless appliance package. There is a vented washer dryer, a large spa bath with huge sink and luxurious vanity, a working fireplace in the large bedroom, and a private slate terrace, all details that will maximize income. With annual taxes of $4,193, that won't be difficult.
Even the basement has been described as ""beautiful."" Behind the scenes, you'll find two new, dedicated boilers and energy saving hot water heaters, and two separate gas meters. The house has been insulated for sound and pre-wired for FIOS, cable, wi-fi, and cameras. All fans and vents exhaust out. The doors are solid oak and oversized. In short, there is nothing left here to do but enjoy the fabulous renovation.
194 MacDonough Street is on one of the most picturesque brownstone blocks in the Bedford Historic District. It’s two blocks from the C train at Kingston-Throop and a short walk to the A express at Utica or Nostrand. Stuyvesant Heights offers easy access to some of New York’s best restaurants and clubs. This very special house is for the discerning home buyer who appreciates luxury and comfort, and a lucrative rental unit, or the investor who targets only the highest quality properties with plenty of upside."

Jackson, 21 Brevoort Place is a quintessentially grand Brooklyn brownstone on an unusually deep 141-foot lot. This 5-story, 20-foot wide townhouse was designed for the grandeur of a bygone era, with an impressive façade that sits high up off the street and parlor floor ceilings that soar over 11 feet high. Tall windows let light deep into the house all day long, especially from the south facing front. This beautiful home sits in the middle of a quiet tree-lined street that runs just one block and therefore gets very little traffic.
Originally built for a single family, 21 Brevoort Place is now configured with five apartments, one per floor. The current owners completed a meticulous gut renovation in 2001, with great care taken to preserve the building’s original Italianate and Neo-Grec design elements, including six marble fireplace mantles, pumpkin pine floors, the original staircase, and original woodwork throughout. The renovation included the installation of all new electric, plumbing, heating, kitchens, bathrooms, windows, and much more. In 2017 the brownstone façade and stoop were completely redone by skilled artisans.
Each apartment is equipped with its own boiler and hot water heater in the basement, giving tenants the ability to control the heat in their respective apartments and pay their own heat and hot water separately. Having the utilities separate provides flexibility to reconfigure the building into two, three, or four apartments. It would be easy to combine the garden and parlor floor apartments into a garden duplex, as the interior staircase linking the two is completely intact. It would also be easy to condo the building and sell some or all of the apartments separately. Zoning allows for a large extension. Or keep this great multi-family building just as it is, and watch the high-value market rate rents appreciate over time. Opportunities abound!
The backyard sprawls across 88 feet, which is two or three times larger than most Brooklyn townhouse backyards. This wonderfully tranquil oasis from the bustle of the City awaits your green thumb. With this much space there’s plenty of room for just about any project you can imagine!
